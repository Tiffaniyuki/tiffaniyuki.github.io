				<h3>Hirosaki Castle</h3>
				<p class="bb">Hirosaki park is a famous hosting place for many events in Hirosaki city. It hosts multiple seasonal events such as, the Sakura Festival in spring, The leaf-viewing festival in Autumn and the snow lantern festival in the winter. It is a place commonly visited by the locals looking for relaxation. The castle, symbol of the park, is one of the few Japanese castles that has been preserved and remains to this day in its original structure persisting throughout the ages. With the recent explosion in popularity from the anime Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba), another park attraction has quickly gained popularity for sharing the reading of its name with the protagonist’s sister Nezuko: A tree said to be over 500 years old. There is also a very popular spot for picture taking known as the heart sakura, where the branches of two different trees form the shape of a heart.</p><br>

				<h3>Harmonica Yokocho</h3>
				<p class="bb">This clutch of narrow alleys, a short walk from the north exit of JR Kichijoji station, is stuffed to the gills with hole-in-the wall eateries. A yellow sign marks the entrance to Harmonica Yokocho, which takes its name from the layout of the vendors, slotted cheek-to-jowl along the passageways like the reeds in a harmonica. The atmospheric network of lanes started out as a post-war flea market in the 1940s, but the area underwent a transformation in the 90s when bustling bars and restaurants made their entrance onto the scene. It has a laid-back and hyper-local feel, especially during the daytime, when you’ll find fishmongers and traditional sweets makers plying their trades</p><br>

				<h3>Gotokuji Temple</h3>
				<p class="bb">Gotokuji Temple, located in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo, is a Buddhist temple that is said to be the birthplace of the maneki-neko, or “luck-inviting cat figurine.” These small statues, which portray a cat sitting up and beckoning with its front paw, have become quite popular all over the world with cat-lovers. Although there are many different kinds of maneki-neko raising either their right or left paws, Gotokuji Temple specializes in the right-pawed version of this good-luck symbol.</p><br>
